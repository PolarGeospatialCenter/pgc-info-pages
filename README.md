# PGC Information Pages
The PGC Information Pages is a stand-alone web application that displays a continuous slide of selected content, much like a slideshow. It runs in a web browser, but meant for display on a High-Definition (HD) display, such as a television or computer screen. The application is somewhat responsive to different screen resolutions, but is optimized for 16:9 displays.
